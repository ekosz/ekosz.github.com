title: test driven Clojure part II

In my last post we talked about the tools we're going to use for this project.
Now we're going to get set up with these tools so we can get coding next.

### Setup

The first thing we'll need is Leiningen, as it will be the tool to download the
rest of our dependencies.

If you're worried about control of your system you can go to Leiningen's
[Github Page](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) and get detailed
instructions on installation.  For everyone else, running the following command
should get you setup.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir ~/bin && 
cd ~/bin && 
wget https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/preview/bin/lein &&
chmod 755 lein
{% endhighlight %}

To be continued...
